        <h6>WHO I AM?</h6>
        <div class="container">
        <p class="left">An aspiring Spacecraft Engineer. My unwavering devotion to astrophysics is driven by an insatiable curiosity for the universe, particularly in sun exploration—a field where I envision making significant contributions.</p>
        <p class="right">As a working engineering student, I've developed a strong foundation in mechanical design, becoming proficient in tools like CATIA and other CAD programs. My technical repertoire also includes experience with FEA and CFD programs, utilizing software such as MATLAB, with skills honed through various courses and trainings detailed in my CV</p>
        <p class="left">Beyond my foundational interests, I’m equally fascinated by technology evolution, artificial intelligence, and, more recently, business management. These interests continuously influence my growth and outlook as I navigate my journey into the aerospace world.</p>
        <p class="right">While my academic pursuits keep me busy, I find joy and inspiration in various hobbies. Drawing, hiking, and stargazing allow me to unwind and connect with my creative and adventurous sides. I love immersing myself in books and I am also a tinker at heart electronics is my thing. In my downtime, I’m an avid football, basketball, and MMA fan, and, as they say, a good chess player.</p>
        <p class="left">This is just a glimpse into my world as I delve deeper into the mysteries of the cosmos. Feel free to explore my CV for more detailed information on my academic and professional experiences.</p>
